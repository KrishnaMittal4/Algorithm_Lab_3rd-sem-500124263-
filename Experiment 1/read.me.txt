1. Recursive Insertion in a Binary Search Tree (BST):
Description: In the recursive approach, the function calls itself repeatedly
to traverse the tree until it finds the correct position to insert the new node. 
The insertion starts at the root, and for each node, if the value to be inserted is less than the current node's key,
the function recurses into the left subtree; otherwise, it recurses into the right subtree.

Iterative Insertion in a Binary Search Tree (BST):
Description: In the iterative approach, a loop is used to traverse the tree.
Starting at the root, the function iteratively moves left or right, 
depending on whether the value to be inserted is smaller or larger than the current node's key.
Once it finds the correct position, it inserts the new node.
